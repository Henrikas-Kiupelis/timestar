Decouple DSLContext entirely from all non-DAO classes (export all methods to new DAO classes)
    use Function and Predicate or similar to wrap query classes inside Domain objects!

Export:
    Field + jooq (goodlike-commons)

API v3 for lesson (and rest) with multiple DTO classes + resolution of DTO -> Domain and inverse (if time allows)
