NEVER. NEVER CLOSE THIS FILE.

NEVER.

This file should contain a rough list of ideas/things to be done in the future:

A) Things to definitely do in the future

    Implement code checking again!
            Use:
                List of Student ids to check against;
                a code
    FIX API if any errors

B) Ideas

	Add deleted timestamp to all tables
	Make tables use views for operations, based on whether they are deleted or not
