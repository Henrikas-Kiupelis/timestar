NEVER. NEVER CLOSE THIS FILE.

NEVER.

This file should contain a rough list of ideas/things to be done in the future:

A) Things to definitely do in the future



    Equality testing based on getter Functions

    Change date requests to timestamp choose one - timestamp value, or valid TimeZone in JSON

    Add paymentDay fields to Student/Customer, however they should be calculated from their startDate fields, i.e. in the
    getter method (or cached, tho I don't think that's needed)

    Make FullAttendance a mix of actual objects (i.e. lesson + students) rather than just ids (similar for groups)
    CHECK IF STUDENTS FROM LESSON ATTENDANCE ACTUALLY BELONG TO APPROPRIATE GROUP

B) Ideas

	Add deleted timestamp to all tables
	Make tables use views for operations, based on whether they are deleted or not
