NEVER.

This file should contain a rough list of ideas/things to be done in the future:

A) Things to definitely do in the future

	Set it up so lessons can be added at any time, but there would be a checking method to know, if there are overlaps

B) Ideas

	Add deleted timestamp to all tables
	Make tables use views for operations, based on whether they are deleted or not

C) COMPLETE
