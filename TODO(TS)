NEVER.

This file should contain a rough list of ideas/things to be done in the future:

A) Things to definitely do in the future

	Groups need a new field, language field; they will only have one language
	Customers no longer have explicit languages, rather, they have languages which their groups have instead
	    therefore, customers need explicit groups (more specifically, groups need a customerId field again)
	Groups can have separate contracts, without any customer, therefore customerId should be optional
	Students should be able to be in multiple groups, and not necessarily belong to a customer

	Move the monetary value of contracts from customers to teachers (who should have 2 different rates,
	specifically 'per hour' and 'per academic hour' which don't depend on each other, that is
	'per hour' != 3/4 * 'per academic hour'

B) Ideas

	Add deleted timestamp to all tables
	Make tables use views for operations, based on whether they are deleted or not
