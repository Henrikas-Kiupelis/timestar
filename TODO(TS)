NEVER. NEVER CLOSE THIS FILE.

NEVER.

This file should contain a rough list of ideas/things to be done in the future:

A) Things to definitely do in the future

    Make SQL checks; fill in startdate automatically if customer ID is provided for students, etc (CONFIRM FIRST!)
    Implement builder for Student

    Make FullAttendance a mix of actual objects (i.e. lesson + students) rather than just ids (similar for groups)
    CHECK IF STUDENTS FROM LESSON ATTENDANCE ACTUALLY BELONG TO APPROPRIATE GROUP

B) Ideas

	Add deleted timestamp to all tables
	Make tables use views for operations, based on whether they are deleted or not
