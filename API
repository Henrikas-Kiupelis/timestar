API V2:

First of all, the API is partitioned. This basically means that depending on the user who is accessing the API,
a different portion of the database will be used. All API calls are available only for the user's partition, with
the exception of the partition API itself.
Generally, this means that the username authorization is slightly more complicated (partition id must be added to the
auth header) - this might be changed at a later date - but for all intents and purposes, every partition functions
in exactly the same manner.

Secondly, all APIv2 calls will have the following prefix, unless stated otherwise:

    http://{IP}:{PORT}/timestar/api/v2/

The API might switch to HTTPS eventually.

All the methods will be given in this format (example):

(1)    GET  /lesson/table/{pageId}
(2)         pageId      int            0 < pageId <= MAX_INT
(3)    OPT  per_page    int            0 < per_page <= 100; DEF 6
(4)    OPT  start_date  java.sql.Date  any; DEF today
(5)    OPT  end_date    java.sql.Date  any; DEF start_date
(6)    RET  com.superum.db.lesson.table.core.LessonTable

GET refers to the HTTP method the request expects;
/lesson/table are constant mappings, which should always be in the request;
/{pageId} is a mutable mapping; it must also always be in the request, but just like a normal parameter,
    it can have different values and has certain limitations;
(2) shows what the limitations for {pageId} are; specifically, that it is an integer and must be positive;
(3) to (5) show parameters; REQ means that the parameter must be in the request, whereas OPT means that
this parameter can be skipped; finally, if the parameter is optional, then it WILL provide the default value
using the

    ; DEF

modifier; in this case, if per_page is not present, it defaults to 6; if start_date is not present, it defaults to
today's date; if end_date is not present, it defaults to start_date
(which will be today's date, if it also was not present)
(6) shows what kind of Class object is returned by the request, assuming it is successful; JSON format is used in all
methods, unless stated otherwise; please refer to the appropriate Class documentation
One more modifier exists:

    BODY

which means that the method expects HTTP Body part; it also specifies a particular Class, just like RET.

Finally, all API methods expect an auth header, unless stated otherwise;
Currently (2015-07-20) a BASIC auth header is used:

    Authentication: Basic base64(username:password)

It is important to note, that username takes the following form:

    partitionId.actualUsername

This allows same username/email/etc to be used in separate partitions;
This will be changed into a more secure scheme at a later date, when the basic functionality of the app has been
realized and somewhat tested.

Next, there will be a short description of the method, including:
1) what the method does; if there's any special behaviour it is necessarily described here;
2) when will the method fail, and what error response you can expect as a result;
   obvious failures, such as breaking the limitations of parameters or failing to provide requires ones are omitted;
3) the structure/meaning of the returned value; this can be described in 1) if it makes sense to do so;

1)
    PUT   /customer
    BODY  com.superum.api.customer.ValidCustomerDTO
    RET   com.superum.api.customer.ValidCustomerDTO

    Creates a new customer;

    It will fail if:
    a) HTTP 400; the id field was set;
    b) HTTP 400; a mandatory field was not set;

    Returned FullCustomer will have its id field set;

2)
    GET  /customer/{customerId}

    Reads and returns an existing customer;

    It will fail if:
    a) HTTP 404; no customer with provided id exists;

3)
    POST  /customer
    BODY  com.superum.api.customer.ValidCustomerDTO
    RET   void

    Updates an existing customer; only fields that are sent are updated;

    It will fail if:
    a) HTTP 400; the id field was not set;
    b) HTTP 400; only the id field was set and no other fields were;
    c) HTTP 404; no customer with provided id exists;

    Returned FullCustomer contains all the fields as they were before updating;

4)
    DELETE  /customer/{customerId}
            customerId     int            1 <= customerId <= MAX_INT
    RET     void

    Deletes an existing customer;

    It will fail if:
    a) HTTP 404; no customer with provided id exists;

    Returned FullCustomer contains all the fields as they were before deleting;

    3) teachers are responsible for groups;
    4) so, a customer is tied to a teacher if they have any students in any groups that the teacher is responsible for;

    It will fail if:
    a) HTTP 404; no teacher with provided id exists;

    Returned List is paged; using DEF parameter values, only first 25 customers will be returned; to access the rest,
    the page parameter must be incremented, or per_page value raised;
