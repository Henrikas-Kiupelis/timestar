Detailed bug description:
After writing a couple of assertions using MockMvc, Hamcrest would fail to recognize that long values would be equal to int values. I.e.
Expected: is <1L>
but: was <1>

Solutions:
1) Manually cast numbers to int;

2) Manually create a matcher which would test if a long matches an int;
