Detailed bug description:
I tried to autowire DSLContext (inside DefaultSqlQuery) and use it multiple times to make DefaultSqlQueries inner classes.
This resulted in DSLContext being null in one (possibly two?) of DefaultQueries after the first one. Making the inner
classes static had no effect.

Solutions:
1) I've managed to re-purpose the DefaultQueries classes in a way that allows autowiring them directly; before that, I
simply did not autowire DefaultSqlQueries anymore and just used DSLContext which was autowired into the service/DAO instead.
