Detailed bug description:
File 'build.gradle' was edited with sensitive information (username/password/etc for JOOQ table generation).
As a result, file 'build.gradle' was added to '.gitignore', however, after pushing, the file was still present in the commit.
The pushed file included all of the changes, including the sensitive information.

Solutions:
1) Prevention
If you need to add sensitive information,
	a) add it in files not already present in the commits;
	b) add the file to .gitignore before editing it for sensitive information, create a commit to verify it is ignored,
		only then add sensitive information
		
2) Fix (if it's already done, but the information is not critical)
Use git command line to:
	a) git reset --hard 71c27777543ccfcb0376dcdd8f6777df055ef479
		Replace the string of characters with the reference to a previous commit that does not have the sensitive information.
		This will delete the commits before that, so any other changes to the code should be saved manually!
	b) git push --force
	
3) Fix (if it's already done and the information is critical)
Change whatever critical information that was shared (i.e. passwords). Basically, assume worst case scenario.

4) It is possible that refreshing the project on Eclipse after editing the .gitignore would suffice (unconfirmed as of 2015-03-31)
