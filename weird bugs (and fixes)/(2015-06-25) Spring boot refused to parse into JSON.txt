Detailed bug description:
Testing the new web service, "/timestar/api/lesson/table", which is supposed to return a JSON representation of the front end table,
the GET request would return 404, the same kind you get when the mapping was not found.
Oddly enough, ALL the code would execute, that is, logs would show that the DB was being accessed and table was made. It would
simply stop at the last step of turning it into JSON and responding.
After turning on debug logging for org.springframework.web, it appears it attempted to find a view for the method, but failed.

Solutions:
1) Annotate the method which causes trouble with "@ResponseBody" - this seems to fix the issue
