Detailed bug description:
I tried to commit some new changes with git, Intellij Idea to be more specific;
this failed spectacularly with error:
“Commit failed with error: pathspec … did not match any file(s)”
After running 'git status', it was revealed that git thought the file had a lowercase letter;
It appears this happened:
1) I created a class called "Somethingtests";
2) I added it to git
3) I changed the name later to "SomethingTests";
This caused git to fail to recognize the file exists, and still look for "Somethingtests" instead

Solutions:
1) run 'git config core.ignorecase false' - seems to have fixed the issue, but running 'git status' still shows buggyness
2) run 'git mv -f File file', first and second file differing only in the case; this will completely resolve the issue
