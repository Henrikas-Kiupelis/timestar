Detailed bug description:
I tried to test a certain Controller, which for now returned an object constructed in exactly the same manner.
Despite looking exactly the same, and the String values being identical, the test claimed they were not equal.
Using debug I was able to find out that the two java.sql.Date objects inside failed the equality test, despite
showing the same Date in String form.
It appears internally Date objects are compared using long millisecond values they represent; however, the values
were different on the Dates! One of them was initialised with an offset of 3 hours, using EEST timezone, whereas
the other one was UTC. 

Solutions:
1) Compare Dates with String values; they are identical, and likely faster to compare than building a GregorianCalendar.
