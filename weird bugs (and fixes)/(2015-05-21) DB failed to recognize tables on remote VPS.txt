Detailed bug description:
After creating the database on the VPS, the spring-boot jar file would throw exceptions trying to access it.
They indicated that the tables did not exist, despite evidence to the contrary.
It turns out that the database was queried lower case by JOOQ, while the database in VPS (which was running CentOS7 ~ Linux) was upper case/

Solutions:
1) Only use lower case for database names due to Linux-like systems being case sensitive. Field names seem fine.
