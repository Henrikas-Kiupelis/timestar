Detailed bug description:
After sending a request with String "Kiūpelis", the databases would return it:
Home: "Kiūpelis"
Laptop: "Ki?pelis"
Server: "Ki?pelis"
This seems to have been a database issue.

Solutions:
1) Completely re-do the database with utf8mb4 as charset everywhere using the following commands:

ALTER DATABASE "database_name" CHARACTER SET = utf8mb4 COLLATE = utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
(similar commands for tables/columns, but I simply re-made them later, because they were empty)

SET NAMES utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

Then, set up my.ini or my.cnf with following settings:
[client]
default-character-set = utf8mb4

[mysql]
default-character-set = utf8mb4

[mysqld]
character-set-client-handshake = FALSE
character-set-server = utf8mb4
collation-server = utf8mb4_unicode_ci

Then, restart the mysql service

Finally, use 

mysqlcheck -u root -p --auto-repair --optimize --all-databases

To ensure commands work correctly
